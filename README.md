# Driver Behavior Classification and Alert System using Computer Vision

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting distracted driving using **Computer Vision** and **Deep Learning**. The model is trained to classify various driver behaviors using **CNNs**, aiming to enhance road safety by alerting drivers in real-time. The system can be implemented in vehicles to **automate monitoring, reduce accidents, and improve insurance claims processing**.

## Features
- **Deep Learning-Based Driver Classification**: Uses CNNs to classify different driver behaviors.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Detects distractions and alerts drivers instantly.
- **Automated Insurance Claims Support**: Helps insurers verify accident causes.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended with additional safety features like **night vision** and **facial recognition**.

## Problem Statement
Distracted driving is one of the **leading causes of road accidents** worldwide. Traditional monitoring methods are manual and prone to errors. This project leverages deep learning techniques to **automate driver behavior detection**, enhancing road safety and reducing accidents.

## Objective
The key objectives of this project include:
- Developing a **CNN model** to classify driver behaviors.
- Training the model on a **diverse dataset** for robustness.
- Implementing a **real-time alert system** for distracted drivers.
- Improving **road safety and reducing accident rates**.

## Dataset
The model is trained on the **State Farm Distracted Driver Dataset**, which includes **22,424 images** categorized into different driver behaviors such as:
- Normal driving
- Texting while driving
- Talking on the phone
- Eating/drinking
- Adjusting the radio

Data **augmentation techniques** (rotation, flipping, scaling) are applied to improve model performance.

## Model Architecture
The system uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with:
- **Convolutional Layers** â€“ Extract local image features.
- **Max Pooling Layers** â€“ Reduce dimensionality and computational load.
- **Dropout Layers** â€“ Prevent overfitting.
- **Fully Connected Layers** â€“ Perform final classification.
- **Softmax Activation** â€“ Outputs class probabilities.
